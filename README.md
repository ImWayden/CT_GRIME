## Comments
Im kinda happy with the result for a first Trainer, Lot of things could be upgraded.
The cheatable does not contain the form nor the lua script and i don't know if i had already added the LaunchMonoDataCollector() inside the scripts.
The trainer is flagged by antivirus and i have no idea how not to get flagged, i read that i could sign it

## To Do: (i'll probably not)
-add some polish to the design
-add more cheats(upgrade ignorehit,spam attack in air,unlock ingame teleport,spike doesn't reset pos,no clip, short range tp)
-make the error panel closable by clicking the cross
-delete the 2 lines in the ComboBox Tstring
-Find Some good coords to add to the customteleport so player won't have to find it
themself and add another ComboBox to manage that
-making an update function to update value inside the Custom Values Panel 
-Add Possibility to Freeze values in the Custom Values Panel
-Add Keybind, keybind panel to customize key and or to see keybind
-Add little panel when hovering a button that contain the text with the associated keybind
-Add sound on + - and Activate buttons
-Fix the Activate Button wich is always on deactivate at app Start
-Add Color or image to the design
-Find a way to not get Flag by Antivirus
